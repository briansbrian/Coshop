Generate multiple focused documents covering:\n\n1. Project architecture and service structure\n2. Feature implementations and their logic flows\n3. Database schema and relationships\n4. API endpoints and integration points\n5. Key business logic and algorithms\n\nMake documentation precise and LLM-friendly with minimal code snippets. Focus on explaining WHAT each component does, WHY it exists, and HOW it connects to other parts. Use clear hierarchical organization so developers can quickly locate information for updates or bug fixes."
